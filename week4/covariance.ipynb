    "# Section: Covariance Geometry in a Two-Asset World - Review Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 1: Explain how a covariance matrix summarizes joint risk in a two-asset setting.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# In a two-asset world, the covariance matrix is a 2×2 symmetric matrix that captures both individual asset risks (variances on the diagonal) and their joint risk (covariance on the off-diagonals). \n",
    "# It fully describes how the assets co-move: positive covariance means they tend to rise/fall together (amplifying portfolio risk), negative means opposite movements (diversification benefit), and zero means independent risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2: Define correlation and explain how it differs from covariance in interpretation.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# Correlation ρ is the standardized covariance: ρ = cov / (σ₁ σ₂), bounded between -1 and +1.\n",
    "# Unlike covariance (which has units of squared returns and depends on asset volatilities), correlation is unitless and directly measures the strength and direction of linear co-movement—making it easier to interpret and compare across different asset pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3: Describe how portfolio variance depends on weights, variances, and covariance.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# For weights w and (1-w), portfolio variance is:\n",
    "# σ_p² = w² σ₁² + (1-w)² σ₂² + 2 w (1-w) cov₁₂\n",
    "# It is a quadratic function of weights: individual weighted variances plus a term that scales with covariance (positive cov increases variance, negative reduces it via diversification).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 4: Explain the role of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the geometry of covariance.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# The eigenvalues represent the variance along the principal axes (eigenvectors) of the risk ellipse.\n",
    "# The larger eigenvalue is the direction of maximum risk (major axis), the smaller is minimum risk (minor axis). Eigenvectors are orthogonal directions of uncorrelated risk factors; together they diagonalize the matrix and reveal the geometric structure (ellipse orientation and scale).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 5: Summarize why the minimum-variance portfolio has a geometric interpretation.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# The minimum-variance portfolio corresponds to the point where the risk ellipse is tangent to the vertical line through the portfolio weights (or the \"shortest\" distance from origin in risk space).\n",
    "# Geometrically, it lies along the minor axis of the ellipse (direction of least variance) and represents the tightest possible risk for a given return constraint, visualizing the benefit of diversification."
