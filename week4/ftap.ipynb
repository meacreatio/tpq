    "# Section: Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing (FTAP) - Review Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 1: State the First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing (FTAP I) in its most common form.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# FTAP I: A market is arbitrage-free if and only if there exists at least one positive state-price vector (or risk-neutral probability measure Q) that correctly prices all traded assets.\n",
    "# Interpretation: No free lunch (arbitrage) ⇔ existence of consistent pricing kernel/state prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2: Explain what \"no-arbitrage\" means and why it is a minimal requirement for sensible pricing.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# No-arbitrage: No portfolio with zero/negative initial cost that yields non-negative payoffs and positive probability of positive payoff.\n",
    "# Minimal requirement: Violates rationality (free money) — prices must be consistent to prevent risk-free profits; foundation for all valuation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3: State the Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing (FTAP II).\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# FTAP II: In an arbitrage-free market, the market is complete (every claim replicable) if and only if the risk-neutral measure Q is unique.\n",
    "# Interpretation: Uniqueness of Q ⇔ perfect hedging/span all payoffs with traded assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 4: Describe the relationship between state prices, risk-neutral measures, and the pricing kernel.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# State prices ψ_s: Price today of $1 in state s (positive for no-arb).\n",
    "# Risk-neutral Q: q_s = ψ_s (1+r) (normalized, probabilities under Q).\n",
    "# Pricing kernel m_s: m_s = ψ_s (discounted) or β u'(c_s)/u'(c_0) in equilibrium—links to preferences.\n",
    "# All equivalent ways to express no-arb consistent valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 5: Why do FTAP I and II matter for practical asset pricing and hedging?\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# FTAP I: Guarantees consistent, arb-free prices (core to derivatives valuation, e.g., Black-Scholes no-arb).\n",
    "# FTAP II: Enables replication/hedging (complete markets like options on liquid stocks).\n",
    "# Real-world: Incomplete markets (FTAP II fails) → bounds/approximate hedges; FTAP foundation for risk-neutral pricing/Monte Carlo in finance."
