    "# Section: Efficient Markets Hypothesis – Theory and Tests - Review Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 1: State the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) in its most general form.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# The Efficient Markets Hypothesis states that asset prices fully reflect all available information, making it impossible to consistently achieve abnormal risk-adjusted returns (beat the market) through trading or analysis. \n",
    "# In formal terms: No trading strategy based on available information can have positive expected excess return (no \"free lunch\").\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2: Distinguish between the weak, semi-strong, and strong forms of EMH.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# - Weak-form: Prices reflect all past price/volume information (technical analysis useless; returns unpredictable from history).\n",
    "# - Semi-strong: Prices reflect all public information (past + news/announcements; fundamental analysis useless).\n",
    "# - Strong-form: Prices reflect all information, public and private (even insider trading can't beat market consistently).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3: Explain Samuelson’s logic linking fair pricing to market efficiency.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# Samuelson argued that in a properly functioning market, prices should be \"martingale fair\"—future expected price equals current price adjusted for risk-free rate/cost of carry.\n",
    "# This implies unpredictable excess returns (random walk under risk-neutral measure). Efficiency arises from rational traders eliminating mispricings quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 4: Why is EMH considered a \"baseline\" rather than an absolute truth in modern finance?\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# EMH provides a null hypothesis: Markets are hard to beat consistently. It benchmarks active strategies (alpha hard/expensive) and justifies passive indexing.\n",
    "# Real deviations (anomalies, behavioral biases) exist, but EMH remains useful baseline—most can't outperform net of costs, supporting derivatives pricing (no-arb) and policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 5: Name two common empirical tests for weak-form efficiency and interpret a failure.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# Tests: Autocorrelation/serial correlation of returns (should be zero), runs test/variance ratio (random walk checks).\n",
    "# Failure (significant autocorrelation): Predictable patterns → potential profitable trading (e.g., momentum/reversal anomalies), suggesting inefficiency or risk premia not captured."
